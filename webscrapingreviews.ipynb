I love the first three but this one is going back for a number of reasons. My first issue is with assembling the tent. I had my husband helping me with this and I am surprised we didn’t come to blows because this was the most frustrating and difficult tent I have ever tried to assemble. For context, I have a Base Camp 6 that I have put up by myself many times so it isn’t lack of experience. Once we finally got the tent up, the next thing I noticed was the lack of storage inside the tent. There is room for pockets at both ends of the tent but there aren’t any at the back or on the sides of the tent. I can’t be the only one who likes a pocket near my head for glasses and head lamp storage. When we took the tent down at the end of our trip, it was an absolute nightmare fitting back in the bag it came in. If you don’t fold it just right, it isn’t going back in that bag without a fight. Do not attempt this while hangry. On a positive note, the tent did keep us dry during a couple of strong storms. The rainfly doesn’t look like it would be protective but it does a solid job keeping the rain out.

It’s not my favorite tent and now the floor almost seems like it has shrank. When I set it up there is a section of the floor that is raised up with a fold in it. I’t weird. I talked to REI about it and they don’t take returns for tents after a year (or something like that). I want to exchange it for a different one like maybe the REI Kingdom. I’ll try and get it set up in my backyard and snap some pictures of what’s going on. REI told me to contact North Face directly.

       "  'ReviewText': 'This is my 4th REI tent. I love the first three but this one is going back for a number of reasons. My first issue is with assembling the tent. I had my husband helping me with this and I am surprised we didn’t come to blows because this was the most frustrating and difficult tent I have ever tried to assemble. For context, I have a Base Camp 6 that I have put up by myself many times so it isn’t lack of experience. Once we finally got the tent up, the next thing I noticed was the lack of storage inside the tent. There is room for pockets at both ends of the tent but there aren’t any at the back or on the sides of the tent. I can’t be the only one who likes a pocket near my head for glasses and head lamp storage. When we took the tent down at the end of our trip, it was an absolute nightmare fitting back in the bag it came in. If you don’t fold it just right, it isn’t going back in that bag without a fight. Do not attempt this while hangry. On a positive note, the tent did keep us dry during a couple of strong storms. The rainfly doesn’t look like it would be protective but it does a solid job keeping the rain out. On a more positive note, REI has a very generous return policy for members and I am able to return this tent and get one that is a better fit for me. I would not repurchase or recommend this particular tent.',\n",
